# (SM-DST) Similarity-based Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking withCopy Mechanisms for Task-based Virtual Personal Assistants

This is our implementation for the paper:

Similarity-based Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking withCopy Mechanisms for Task-based Virtual Personal Assistants. Jarana Manotumruksa, Jeff Delton, Edgar Meij and Emine Yilmaz. In Proceedings of WWW 2022.

**Please cite our WWW'22 paper if you use our codes. Thanks!** 

We re-use the origial source code of TripPy to implement our proposed SM-DST model.
